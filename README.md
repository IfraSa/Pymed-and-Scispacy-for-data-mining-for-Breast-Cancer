# Pymed-and-Scispacy-for-text-mining-for-Breast-Cancer
A significant source of biomedical data is the PubMed database. Every researcher's life typically includes gathering data from it. Either manually or through PubMed APIs. ScispaCy is a Python package that contains spaCy models for processing biomedical, scientific, or clinical literature, and PyMed is a Python library that offers access to PubMed using the PubMed API. The current repository demonstrated how to gather data from the PubMed database and apply text mining to it for the breast cancer disease.
